drang-run
=========

  A simple command line tool to create sequences of numbers.

``drang-run`` is comparable to  ``jot`` or ``seq``, but with a more intuitive interface. It was inspired (and named after) `a post by Dr. Drang <https://leancrew.com/all-this/2020/09/running-numbers/>`_.

Installation
============

Just install like any other package:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip3 install drang-run
